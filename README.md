3. Technologies used:
HTML-HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It structures the content on the internet by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML uses tags to define various parts of a web page, providing a hierarchical structure that web browsers use to render content.We have used it for creating dynamic web pages in our website.
CSS-CSS is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It enables web designers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing of multiple web pages simultaneously. We have implemented it to style and cater our web pages.
JAVASCRIPT-JavaScript is a versatile scripting language commonly used for web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web content. JavaScript can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, perform asynchronous operations, and create interactive features such as form validation and it is used in our site for user friendly experience as well as navigation.
AJAX- A technique used in web development to create asynchronous web applications. It allows data to be exchanged between the client and server without reloading the entire web page. With AJAX, web pages can fetch and send data to a server in the background, enabling dynamic content updates and improving the user experience by making web applications faster and more responsive. We have used it to fetch data regarding professors and subject alongwith semester.
CAROUSEL-A carousel is a web component that displays a series of images or content items in a rotating manner. Users can navigate through the items by clicking on navigation buttons or indicators. We have used it for our Dashboard and Homepage.
BOOTSTRAP CAROUSEL-Bootstrap Carousel is a component provided by the Bootstrap framework, a popular front-end CSS framework. It is an implementation of a carousel that comes with pre-designed styles and features.
